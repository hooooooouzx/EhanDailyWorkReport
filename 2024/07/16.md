# do what
1、Learn English for 2 hours
2、Learn how to prepar and roll out an apk to Google Play Store
3、fix up the error when run:flutter build apk
    Originally,I thought it's a bug or an error,so I found some solution.One answer with many likes said 
    "1.flutter clean  2.flutter pub get  3.cd android 4.gradlew clean 5.gradlew build",and I do like this.And the first four commands went smoothly,but the fifth command took me three or four hours.I finally gave up
    in fact,stuck it's not a error,it's only because the network to google is very slow,so I stuck at "Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease' ... ",like my emotion,I felt stuck too.But I found many solution of this issue,none help me at last.I don't fix the error when I run "gradle build",UCropActivity and ForegroundService also error,I can't be patient,and I run "flutter build apk" directly.
    It may sound strange,but I find that the final apk file could be generated, but it would take a little longer.
