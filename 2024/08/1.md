# Today's Work Log
Talkkia:
1.Handling the issue of receiving codes from countries other than Pakistan in Talkkia is not a problem with the code or API. The SMS shows as sent but is not received by the recipient (e.g., in the Philippines and China). This could be due to filtering or restrictions by local operators. Tomorrow, I will contact Twilio's help center to determine the root cause.
Goofball:
1.Evaluate the development time and cost for the two features of Goofball.
